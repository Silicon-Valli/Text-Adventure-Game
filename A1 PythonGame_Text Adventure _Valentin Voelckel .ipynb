    "    \n",
    "    You will be sent on a quest to find the holy grail, which is located in a \n",

    "    and prove that you have the right gut feeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "    This game consists of three stages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1) The Basecamp: Put the right item into your backpack to pass obstacles. \n",
    "    2) The Path: Your destiny lies in the hands of the gods. You roll the dice to \n",
    "    decide whether to go left or right. Only one path will lead you to the temple.\n",
    "    3) The Key to the Grail: The guards demand a password for you to enter. \n",
    "    Use your cheat-sheet and guess smart!\n",
